Daily Pill â€” Medication Reminder
================================

Reminder app for your daily medication. Easy to use and respects your privacy.

------------

Daily Pill can help you remember to take your medicine every day.

It works great if you need to take it in the morning. It shows a reminder on
your lock screen that appears when you pick up the phone for the first time in
the morning. You can answer this reminder with the press of a single button,
without needing to unlock your phone first.

Daily Pill also remembers the exact time when you have taken your medicine.
This can be useful if you need to take it on an empty stomach.

Daily Pill is free and open source software.
It does not display ads, and does not collect your personal information.
